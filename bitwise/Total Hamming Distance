The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Now your job is to find the total Hamming distance between all pairs of the given numbers.

Example:
Input: 4, 14, 2

Output: 6

Explanation: In binary representation, the 4 is 0100, 14 is 1110, and 2 is 0010 (just
showing the four bits relevant in this case). So the answer will be:
HammingDistance(4, 14) + HammingDistance(4, 2) + HammingDistance(14, 2) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.

ALGORITHM:
For each bit position 1-32 in a 32-bit integer, we count the number of integers in the array which have that bit set. 
Then, if there are n integers in the array and k of them have a particular bit set and (n-k) do not, then that bit 
contributes k*(n-k) hamming distance to the total.

    def totalHammingDistance(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        return sum(b.count('0') * b.count('1') for b in zip(*map('{:032b}'.format, nums)))
