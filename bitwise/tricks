Set nth bit
x | (1<<n)

Unset nth bit
x & ~(1<<n)

Toggle nth bit
x ^ (1<<n)

1) Compute the sign of an integer
  //The far left bit is 1 when the value is negative and 0 otherwise;
  // CHAR_BIT is the number of bits per byte (normally 8).
  sign = (v >> (sizeof(int) * CHAR_BIT - 1));
  
 2) Detect if two integers have opposite signs
  bool f = ((x ^ y) < 0);
  
 3)
